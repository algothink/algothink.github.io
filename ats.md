# Learning the ATS (Applied Type System) programming language

## Motivation
Static type checking has grabbed my attention since 2004. At the time I was using Java daily in my job and 
I remember my first exposure to _Types and Programming Languages_ which lead me to learning
Haskell and then a dozen of monad tutorials later I was hooked.

I think Haskell made me a better developer. It expanded the number of different approaches I
can take for solving a problem. It taught me to use types as a specification logic to express more restrictive 
domains for values, parametricity, constraints on functions, and thinking at a higher abstraction level in general.

I'm not a Haskell expert, although I used it to write production systems that are still used today, as well as 
frontends in Purescript which has a lot of similarity.

I wanted to experience the next step, that is coding with a more porwerful and stricter type system. There's
a bunch of candidates: for instance Idris, Agda or ATS.

ATS is the one that brought my interest, first thanks to some awesome presentation by Dish??, and then
because I wanted to understand the similarity with Rust as the due are answering questions such as
how to do system programming more safely without sacrificing performance.
